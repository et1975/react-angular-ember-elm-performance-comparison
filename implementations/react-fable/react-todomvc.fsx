 - title: React TodoMVC with Fable
 - tagline: Unveil the power of React and functional programming!
 - app-style: width:800px; margin:20px auto 50px auto;
 - require-paths: `'classnames': 'lib/classnames/index', 'react': 'lib/react/react-with-addons', 'react-dom': 'lib/react/react-dom'`
 - intro: This is a port of [React TodoMVC](http://todomvc.com/examples/react/) to show how easy
   is to take advantage of the full power of [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) in Fable apps.
   You can also compare the [F# source code](https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/blob/master/samples/browser/react-todomvc/react-todomvc.fsx)
   with the [original JS implementation](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/gh-pages/examples/react)
   to see the advantages of Fable programming. There's also a port of the [React tutorial](https://github.com/fable-compiler/Fable/tree/master/samples/browser/react-tutorial),
   including an express server and hot reloading. And remember [Fable is also compatible with React Native](http://www.navision-blog.de/blog/2016/08/06/fable-react-native/) for mobile development!

## JavaScript bindings and helpers

Fable includes [React bindings and helpers](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fable-import-react)
to make interaction with the tool more idiomatic in F#. We will also load a couple more of
JS libraries: [classnames](https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames) with require.js and
[director](https://github.com/flatiron/director) directly with a `<script>` tag.
We will make them accessible to our program with [Import and Global attributes](https://fable-compiler.github.io/docs/interacting.html#Import-attribute)
respectively.
*)

#r "node_modules/fable-core/Fable.Core.dll"
#load "node_modules/fable-import-react/Fable.Import.React.fs"
#load "node_modules/fable-import-react/Fable.Helpers.React.fs"

open System
open Fable.Core
open Fable.Core.JsInterop
open Fable.Import

// JS utility for conditionally joining classNames together
let [<Import("default","classnames")>] classNames(o: obj): string =
    failwith "JS only"

// Director is a router. Routing is the process of determining what code to run when a URL is requested.
let [<Global>] Router(o: obj): obj =
    failwith "JS only"

(**
## Utility module

This module is the equivalent of [utils.js](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/examples/react/js/utils.js)
in the original implementation. Note we only need a couple of functions to load
and save data from the browser local storage as things like Guid generation
(`System.Guid.NewGuid()`) or record immutable updates are built-in in F#/Fable.

> Because our `Todo` type is really simple (see below), `JSON.parse` will meet our needs.
For more complicated structures see [JSON serialization with Fable](https://fable-compiler.github.io/docs/interacting.html#JSON-serialization). 
*)

module Util =
    let load<'T> key =
        Browser.localStorage.getItem(key) |> unbox
        |> Option.map (JS.JSON.parse >> unbox<'T>)

    let save key (data: 'T) =
        Browser.localStorage.setItem(key, JS.JSON.stringify data)

(**
## Model definiton

This is an almost direct port of [todoModel.js](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/examples/react/js/todoModel.js)
which separates de logic of the app from the views. The biggest difference is with
a line of code we can define our `Todo` type and let the F# compiler statically check
we're always manipulating the structure correctly.
*)

type Todo = { id: Guid; title: string; completed: bool }

type TodoModel(key) =
    member val key = key
    member val todos: Todo[] = defaultArg (Util.load key) [||] with get, set
    member val onChanges: (unit->unit)[] = [||] with get, set

    member this.subscribe(onChange) =
        this.onChanges <- [|onChange|]

    member this.inform() =
        Util.save this.key this.todos
        this.onChanges |> Seq.iter (fun cb -> cb())

    member this.addTodo(title) =
        this.todos <-
            [|{ id=Guid.NewGuid(); title=title; completed=false }|]
            |> Array.append this.todos
        this.inform()

    member this.toggleAll(checked') =
        this.todos <- this.todos |> Array.map (fun todo ->
            { todo with completed = checked' })
        this.inform()

    member this.toggle(todoToToggle) =
        this.todos <- this.todos |> Array.map (fun todo ->
            if todo.id <> todoToToggle.id
            then todo
            else { todo with completed = (not todo.completed) })
        this.inform()

    member this.destroy(todoToDestroy) =
        this.todos <- this.todos |> Array.filter (fun todo ->
            todo.id <> todoToDestroy.id)
        this.inform()

    member this.save(todoToSave, text) =
        this.todos <- this.todos |> Array.map (fun todo ->
            if todo.id <> todoToSave.id
            then todo
            else { todo with title = text })
        this.inform()

    member this.clearCompleted() =
        this.todos <- this.todos |> Array.filter (fun todo ->
            not todo.completed)
        this.inform()

## React views

We enter now in React's realm to define three views: TodoItem, TodoFooter and TodoApp.
We can use classes to define the views as explained in [React docs](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reusable-components.html#es6-classes),
inheriting from `React.Component` and defining a `render` method, where we can use
the DSL defined in Fable's React helper to build HTML elements in a similar fashion
as we would do with JSX. 

> For convenience, we use a module alias (`R`) to shorten references to the React helper.

A big difference from JS is we can define simple models for the state and props
of custom views, either by using records or interfaces, to allow for autocompletion
and static checking, making our app much more robust than by using plain JS objects.

        ]

The next view is `TodoFooter`. This component just presents some buttons below
the Todo list to filter by or change the `completed` property of the Todos.

Same as `TodoItem`, notice the component subscribes to some events (like `OnClick`)
but instead of containing the logic to react to the event it just runs a callback
received from its parent through the `props` object. Remember the state of React
components cannot be directly updated, so this is a way to transmit the event to
the parent and let it re-render the subtree if necessary.

We finish with the `TodoApp` view. This component is the parent of the two previously
defined components, which are invoked in `render` by calling the `R.com` helper.
Notice that, among the arguments of `R.com`, we use F# object expressions to build the props.

In the [original JS implementation](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/blob/gh-pages/examples/react/js/app.jsx#L28)
of `componentDidMount` method, we need to take care to preserve the meaning of `this`
when passing a lambda to another object by using `bind`. Luckily, that's not something
we need to worry about in Fable :)

Note also we haven't defined an interface for the object returned by `Router`,
so we just access its `init` method with the dynamic `?` operator.

## Firing up the app

There's nothing left to do but building our model, mount our `TodoApp` view
in the DOM by using `ReactDom.render` and subscribe to the events. Happy coding!

let model = TodoModel("react-todos")
let render() =
    ReactDom.render(
        R.com<TodoApp,_,_> { model = model } [],
        Browser.document.getElementsByClassName("todoapp").[0]
    ) |> ignore
model.subscribe(render)
render()
